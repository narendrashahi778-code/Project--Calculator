Calculator Web Project
Overview

This project is a basic web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides standard arithmetic operations through a button-based user interface and evaluates expressions dynamically in the browser.

The calculator is fully client-side and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.

Features

Basic arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (−)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Modulus (%)

Clear all input (AC)

Delete last character (DLT)

Decimal support (.)

Double zero (00)

Real-time display updates

Error handling for invalid expressions

Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the calculator

CSS3 – Styling and layout

Vanilla JavaScript – Button handling and expression evaluation

No frameworks. No dependencies.

Project Structure

├── index.html   # Main HTML file (includes CSS and JS)
└── README.md    # Project documentation


Everything is embedded in a single HTML file, which is fine for a small demo but not scalable.

How It Works

The calculator display is a read-only <input> field.

Each button click appends its value to the display.

Special buttons perform specific actions:

AC → Clears the entire display

DLT → Removes the last character

= → Evaluates the expression using JavaScript

Expressions are evaluated using eval() inside a try-catch block to prevent crashes.

How to Run the Project

Download or copy the index.html file.

Open it in any modern web browser.

Start clicking the buttons to perform calculations.

No server required.
